Build a simple responsive web application using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript** (vanilla). The app is a market news sentiment dashboard with three main sections: **시황 (Market Overview)**, **챗봇 (Chatbot)**, and **알림 설정 (Email Alerts)**.

Use Tailwind for styling and JavaScript to toggle between the sections (do not reload the page). All content can use placeholder data for now.

🔹 Layout

1. A **top navigation bar** with three clickable tabs: 
   - “시황”
   - “챗봇”
   - “알림 설정”
2. Clicking a tab should **toggle visibility** of each corresponding section (`display: none` / `block` via JS).
3. Default visible tab = “시황”

🔹 Section 1: “시황” (Market Overview)

Split into two vertical parts:

**Top Half – Summary Overview**
- A container with:
  - `📊 평균 점수 (Average Score)`: [e.g., 72.3]
  - `🏆 최고 점수 품목 (Top Scoring Commodity)`: [e.g., Corn – 89.5]
- Display in large text with color-coded backgrounds.

**Bottom Half – 실시간 시황 점수 (Live Sentiment Cards)**
- Display **5 horizontal cards**, one for each commodity: Corn, Wheat, Copper, WTI, Gold
- Each card shows:
  - Name of the commodity
  - `Sentiment Score` (e.g., 80.2)
  - `Closing Price` (e.g., $632.5)
  - `Price Change` (e.g., ▲2.1%)
  - `Top Keywords` (e.g., “dry weather, exports”)
- Clicking a card **opens a detail view** (you can use another hidden section for the detail view).

✅ Style notes:
- Use Tailwind for all layout and spacing

- Keep color scheme consistent and clean
- Use `hidden` + `block` or `flex` to toggle sections via JavaScript

Do not use any external frameworks like React or Vue. Keep it all in plain HTML/CSS/JS for now.
